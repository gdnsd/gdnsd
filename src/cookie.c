/*************************************************
 * EDNS Cookies implementation/design notes:
 * * Primary Key:
 *   By default, we use a random primary key generated at first startup, which
 *   affords no cross-server sync.  The daemon attempts to persist this to the
 *   rundir and read it back on replace/restart to minimize cookie disruption,
 *   but key i/o to the rundir fails non-fatally with a logged error, in which
 *   case a new key is being generated on every daemon start.  Commonly on
 *   Linux/systemd, the rundir is empty after a reboot, which will cause a new
 *   key to be generated once per server reboot.  Primary key changes cause a
 *   less-desirable (but probably commonly ok) abrupt rift in client cookie
 *   validities.  For cross-server sync (and avoiding said rifts even for
 *   singular servers on reboots), the admin can define a keyfile containing a
 *   pre-defined primary key, which must contain at least 32 bytes of data,
 *   which should be securely-generated random data.  The keyfile can be
 *   updated with a new key from time to time, but this can happen on slow
 *   timescales (e.g. once a year or whatever makes sense for generic secret
 *   key management).
 *
 * * The Time Counter
 *   Standard unix UTC time is divided into 1 hour chunks as a counter that
 *   increments approximately once per unix hour (when the raw time value
 *   modulo 3600 is zero), giving us a simple counter that's synchronized by
 *   the servers' NTP, and steps forward at roughly the same time on all
 *   servers once an hour (+/- a bit of skew is fine).
 *
 * * Runtime Server Secrets used for Server Cookie output:
 *   The runtime secret key is defined by the output of a high-quality
 *   cryptographic KDF function, using the primary key as its secret key, and
 *   the unix hour counter as the subkey id.  While the unix hour is
 *   deterministic and predictable, the primary key isn't, and so the anycast
 *   pool's sequence of runtime secrets isn't predictable by attackers who lack
 *   the secret primary key.
 *
 * * Runtime Secret Rotation/Overlap:
 *   Roughly once per hour (keeping in mind all the blah blah about unix time
 *   and leap seconds, properly), servers update their secrets using the new
 *   unix hour counter as input.  When generating secrets, they all generate 3
 *   secrets named "previous", "current", and "next", corresponding with the
 *   secrets for the previous, current, and next unix hour counter values.
 *   Only "current" is used to generate new server cookies sent to clients, but
 *   all three of the secrets can be used to successfully validate
 *   previously-generated server cookies sent by the client.  With this scheme,
 *   so long as a cookie-enabled client checks in with the server more often
 *   than once every hour, they're guaranteed to smoothly roll over from one
 *   server cookie to the next without ever sending the server an outdated
 *   cookie it doesn't recognize.  Also, so long as NTP sync problems between
 *   servers keep them well under an hour apart in time, there will be at least
 *   some reasonable overlap in server cookie validity between the servers (the
 *   closer the time sync is, the better!), and "next" ensures there's no
 *   issues with "cookies from the future" issued by the first of a
 *   clock-skewed set of servers arriving at another that has not quite rolled
 *   over its time yet.  Assuming sync'd server clocks, the maximum possible
 *   validity window of a client's server cookie is ~2 hours, and the minimum is
 *   ~1 hour.
 *
 * * Actual Server Cookie Generation:
 *   This part happens in the runtime flow of request->response cycles, so it
 *   must be performant.  For this, we use a faster non-cryptographic keyed
 *   hash function with reasonable security properties.  The current runtime
 *   server secret is given as the key, and a concatenation of the client's IP
 *   and client cookie are used as the message to hash, resulting in an 8-byte
 *   hash output as the server cookie value, with reasonable security
 *   properties for edns cookies with ~2h maximum lifetimes.
 *
 * * BADCOOKIE and related:
 *   This server doesn't ever send a BADCOOKIE rcode.  It always includes a
 *   fresh cookie in response to any query that contained a validly-formed
 *   cookie option, whether cookie validation failed or not.  If the optional,
 *   non-default "max_nocookie_response" option is set to limit amplification,
 *   the result is that UDP answers which would've exceeded that size limit and
 *   lack a correct server cookie are answered with the TC-bit set to send the
 *   client over to TCP.  There is no RRL mechanism.
 *
 * * Crypto implementation:
 *   We chose libsodium as the crypto library.  It has nice properties for this
 *   usage, and also seems to fit the bill for other future crypto use in
 *   gdnsd.  Aside from the crypto itself, libsodium helper functions are also
 *   used for random key generation, managing secure memory allocations for key
 *   data, and for constant-time comparisons during cookie validation.
 *   I've avoided the generic algorithm-neutral APIs because we need algorithm
 *   stability across future (possibly async for an anycast server set) major
 *   version upgrades of libsodium, which could change the underlying
 *   algorithms used by those APIs.
 *   Our current algorithm choices are:
 *   blake2b KDF for primary key + salted hour counter -> hourly keys
 *   siphash-2-4 for hourly key + client cookie/ip -> server cookie
