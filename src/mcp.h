// These define the protocol for the socket between MCP and runtime while
// starting up and shutting down, which consists entirely of 1-byte messages.
// During normal runtime operations there are no messages over the socket, it's
// simply held open to verify both sides are alive, and to pass the eventual
// shutdown message from the MCP to the runtime.  If at any time either side
// detects an unexpected close of the socket or any other error (e.g. an
// invalid or unexpected message), it will exit its process (causing the other
// to do the same due to close, if it hadn't already).  Thus they always live
// and die together; one cannot exist (for very long) without the other.
