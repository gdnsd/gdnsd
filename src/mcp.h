// These define the protocol for the socket between MCP and runtime while
// starting up and shutting down, which consists almost entirely of 1-byte
// messages.  During normal runtime operations there are no messages over the
// socket, it's simply held open to verify both sides are alive, and to pass
// the eventual shutdown message from the MCP to the runtime.  If at any time
// either side detects an unexpected close of the socket or any other error
// (e.g. an invalid or unexpected message), it will exit its process (causing
// the other to do the same due to close, if it hadn't already).  Thus they
// always live and die together; one cannot exist (for very long) without the
// other.
// The 1-byte exception is that a bunch more data is sent in the runtime->mcp
// direction immediately after the runtime sends MSG_2MCP_STATS.  The extra
// data starts with a 4-byte uint32_t length in native byte order, and then
// that many bytes follow.

static const char MSG_2MCP_SHUTDOWN    = 'X';

// currently we have to statically allocate a buffer that must
// hold the entire JSON stats response, at a time and place where
// we don't really have that information yet.  The code will fail
// fatally and early if it detects exceeding that limit.  We could
// raise this (reasonably...) or complicate the code communicating
// and setting the maximum at a later point during startup...
