// This header provides APIs for a basic control socket server and client.
// The underlying protocol they speak over the socket is simple:
// 1. All data flow is serial client_request->server_response transactions;
//    there is no unprompted server-pushed output, and no new requests from
//    the client will be accepted until after the server response to the
//    previous request is buffered into the socket.
// 2. All messages are single chunks of binary data, with an implementation
//    defined maximum possible length of UINT32_MAX (~4GB).
// 3. Each request or response starts with a 4 byte length value in native
//    byte order.  Length zero is illegal in both directions.
// 4. Any communications error or data sizes exceeding the soft maximums
//    specified when starting the server will result in immediate connection
//    termination and cleanup.
//
// All control-socket servers get two built-in transaction handlers for free:
// "ping" -> responds with "pong"
// "getpid" -> responds with the server's PID in ASCII Decimal form

// Opaque server and client objects
