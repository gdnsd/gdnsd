// Every independent program which makes use of libgdnsd must call this
// fairly early in its lifecycle, usually right after dmn_init().
// One should assume that everything else in the gdnsd_ namespace from
// libgdnsd depends on this being called first to initialize the library.
//
// This does the following:
//   0) Calls other internal initialization routines for e.g. the
//      network and RNG portions of the library.
//   1) If config_dir is not NULL, uses it to override the compiled-in
//      default configuration directory.
//   2) Parses the primary config file into a vscf data structure,
//      if it's present at all.
//   3) Sets all libgdsnsd-internal directory pathnames for use by
//      gdnsd_resolve_path_foo(), some of which are going to be based on
//      either the config_dir or options => foo_dir within the configuration.
//   4) If check_create_dirs is true, it will also validate the directories'
//      existence and in some cases create them (state, run).  This option
//      should be true if the intent is to start a runtime gdnsd daemon, but
//      false otherwise (e.g. simple commandline programs).
//   5) Returns the parsed vscf config object for further consumption by the
//      caller.  The directory-related options mentioned above will already be
//      marked as consumed for the purposes of later iterating for bad config
//      keys.  The caller is responsible for destroying it via vscf_destroy().
